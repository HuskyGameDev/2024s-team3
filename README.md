# Baba Yaga's Bottles
You play as Baba Yaga selling potions out of your chicken-legged house. 
You must mix ingredients to create potions and discover new recipes to 
keep your customers happy (and to make money). Your money can be spent 
on more ingredients, potion bottles, and cookbooks to learn new potion 
recipes. You also travel the world in your chicken-legged house to reach 
more customers.
